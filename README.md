# Scala Community Build

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/scala/community-builds](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/scala/community-builds?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This repository contains configuration files that enable us to build and test
many Scala open source projects together using Typesafe's
[dbuild](https://github.com/typesafehub/dbuild).

How much is many?  It's over a million lines of Scala code, total.

Why? The main goal of this is to guard against regressions in new
versions of Scala (language, standard library, and modules).
